<a id="cosmos" class="anchor" href="#cosmos" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COSMOS++</h1>

<p>COSMOS++ is a C++ codebase with a Python wrapper that can be compiled and run to generate astrophysical simulations on unstructured grids with local adaptive mesh refinement.</p>

<p>Feel free to visit the project's website or repository page for more information.</p>

<h2>
<a id="compiling" class="anchor" href="#compiling" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compiling</h2>

<p>COSMOS++ requires an MPI compiler for C++ such as <code>mpiCC</code> or <code>mpicxx</code> depending on the compile time environment.</p>

<p>COSMOS++ can be compiled by running the Python wrapper script, <code>cosmos</code>, at the command line, as such</p>

<pre><code>python cosmos main-problem nx ny nz output-dir
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>main-problem -&gt; name of the problem file to be run
nx -&gt; (optional) number of processors dedicated to computing in the x dimension
ny -&gt; (optional) number of processors dedicated to computing in the y dimension
nz -&gt; (optional) number of processors dedicated to computing in the z dimension
output-dir -&gt; (optional) name of the output directory (default: exe-dir)
</code></pre>

<p>Once COSMOS++ is compiled, it immediately begins running the simulation unless the <code>-c</code> flag is passed. All object files are stored in the <code>obj-xxx/</code> folder, where <code>xxx</code> is determined from the local architecture, and will only be regenerated if changes have been made that affect them. Thus, for a 'clean compile,' the <code>obj-desktop/</code> and <code>exe-dir/</code> directories must first be deleted (this is rarely needed), which can be accomplished with the <code>gmake clean</code> command.</p>

<p>COSMOS++ recognizes the compile and runtime environments based on OS variables and copies the corresponding Makefile within the <code>Configure/</code> directory to the Makefile in the project root. If a specific Makefile cannot be found, the Python wrapper uses <code>make.desktop</code>. For personal systems, Mac environments will use <code>make.mac</code> and Linux environments will use the default <code>make.desktop</code>. There are also Makefiles for various clusters that COSMOS++ has previously been compiled on. If a particular cluster does not have a Makefile and it requires quite a bit of customization, please contribute the resulting Makefile to the repository.</p>

<p>Each problem has its own main file containing that problem's configuration and initialization. A full list of them can be found within the <code>Main/</code> and <code>MainProjects/</code> directories in the repository. The main file that is specified at compile time is copied to <code>main.cc</code>, which is the file that is actually compiled for the simulation.</p>

<h2>
<a id="viewing-output" class="anchor" href="#viewing-output" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Viewing Output</h2>

<p>The output of a simulation is contained in the <code>exe-dir</code> directory unless specified otherwise during compilation. It is intended to be viewed using visualization software such as VisIt. Other diagnostic files, such as <code>timings.dat</code> may also be contained within the output directory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="problem-development" class="anchor" href="#problem-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Development</h2>

<p>Each problem has its own main file within <code>Main/</code> or <code>MainProjects/</code> and the file follows this general structure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Problem configuration (number of zones, stop time, dump intervals, method flags)</li>
<li>Initialize MPI</li>
<li>Create the mesh</li>
<li>Initialize physics packages (primitive solver, HRSC/FEM)</li>
<li>Set boundary conditions</li>
<li>Prerefine the mesh (if applicable)</li>
<li>Set initial data (problem specific)</li>
<li>Register fields with solver</li>
<li>Register output fields</li>
<li>Advance solution
If you wish to create a new main file, it is recommended that you copy an existing, working main file and edit it, as needed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="code-documentation" class="anchor" href="#code-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Documentation</h3>

<p>COSMOS++ uses Doxygen to compile code documentation. It must be installed before being able to compile. Here is how to install it on Debian:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install doxygen doxygen-latex doxygen-doc doxygen-gui graphviz
</code></pre>

<p>The Doxygen configuration file is called <code>doxygen-config</code> and documentation can be generated by running</p>

<pre><code>doxygen doxygen-config
</code></pre>

<p>in the repository root. This will create the directory <code>doxygen-docs/</code> in the project root. COSMOS++ is currently configured to generate both HTML and LaTeX documentation. Visit Doxygen's website for more information on how to document C++ with it.</p>

<h3>
<a id="performance-testing" class="anchor" href="#performance-testing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performance Testing</h3>

<p>For performance testing, objects of the class <code>Timer</code> can be registered in <code>Utilities/TimerList.hh</code>. Timers can be nested by creating and specifying a parent timer that will keep track of the total time its children have used. For example,</p>

<pre><code>Timer TimeGetMagneticField("Get Magnetic Field");
Timer TimeGetMagneticFieldOppZone("Get opposite zone", TimeGetMagneticField);
Timer TimeGetMagneticFieldToFace("Projection onto face", TimeGetMagneticField);
</code></pre>

<p>will create two timers and their total time will be kept in the first. The timers must then be declared in the file they will be used in by adding <code>extern Timer TimerName;</code> to the file header. The timers can then be started and stopped by calling their <code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code> methods. Here is how the previous example's timers would be used to time two blocks of code</p>

<pre><code>TimeGetMagneticField.start();

TimeGetMagneticFieldOppZone.start();
code code code
TimeGetMagneticFieldOppZone.stop();

TimeGetMagneticFieldToFace.start();
code code code
TimeGetMagneticFieldToFace.stop();

TimeGetMagneticField.stop();
</code></pre>

<p>After a simulation completes, the timings can be found in the file, <code>timings.dat</code>, contained within the output directory (default: <code>exe-dir/</code>).</p>

<h3>
<a id="regression-testing" class="anchor" href="#regression-testing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Regression Testing</h3>

<p>Regression tests are contained within the <code>RegressionTests/</code> directory and can be run in the same manner as main files. The regression tests in COSMOS++ are typically additional main files that are known to be stable. When adding regression tests, please also add the filename to <code>listOfTests</code> that is within the same directory. The full suite of regression tests can be run using the command line</p>

<pre><code>runRegressionTests
</code></pre>
